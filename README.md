# Breast Cancer Segmentation with Mask R-CNN

This is a project for my thesis dissertation for the MSc program in Data Science and Machine Learning at University College London.

This project uses the [Matterport's Mask R-CNN](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN) architecture to investigate if the model is able to perform instance segmentation on mass lesions in mammogram images. The Mask R-CNN model has been optimized for the natural
image domain and we are interested to know if it transposes to the domain of mammograms.
